# GIZ bootcamp
## Full-stack web development - JS pass task
Task to be passed by candidates of GIZ program.


    1. Fork the repo
    2. Clone the forked repo to your local machine
    3. Commit your solution
    4. push your solution to your forked repo
    5. Send the link of your solution repo over the form


### Instructions
- Download code on your computer and open it within any favourite IDE.
- The code is supposed to work as a bubble sort algorithm, that is used for sorting integers number of the given array in ASC order then again in DESC order. but there are several issues that making the code doesn’t achieve correctness with a good code design and style.

### TO DO:
1. Try to figure out the issue of the sorting algorithm, and fix it to work as expected.
2. Change the code to be well-designed and well-styled.
3. The “numbers” array in the code is mutable!, change a little bit in the code to keep the original one as-it (immutable) and print the new one.
4. Read the numbers list from data.txt file, sort it in ASC order, then store it in a new file called output.txt

### Hints:
* If you don't know how the Bubble sort algorithm works in the simplest way, do a little search.
* It’s preferable to have Node Js installed on your computer.
* Always use the console to debug your code as the simplest debugging process.
* Feel free to use any external package if you feel that you need it.
* Make your code readable as much as you can.
* Don’t forget to add and use the comments in your code and leave your notes for each issue you will fix.
